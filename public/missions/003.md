# Mission // #002
## Epsilon Royal

Acquiring a base of operations now allows for gathering information. Gaining the trust of the Aun's or gaining access by other means has allowed you into the forward operating base. Here Ke has assigned specific points of weakness in the data structure. 
One part of the team will infiltrate while the other pilots provide cover.

# Goals
- Gain any information possible before the larger Aunic ground forces return to the FOB.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed the Aun's will gain awareness of espionage attempts making future retrievals more difficult with improved systems and possible a more aggressive approach to the civilians of Cornucopia.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
