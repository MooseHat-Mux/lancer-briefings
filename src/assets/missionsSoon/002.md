# Mission // #002

## Epsilon Royal

Acquiring a base of operations now allows for gathering information. Will these new found contacts prove fruitful or have the Black Tails found themselves in a deeper pit than when they started?
Here Ke has assigned specific points of weakness in the data structure. 
One part of the team will infiltrate while the others provide cover and support.

# Goals

- Gain any information possible before the larger Aunic ground forces return to the FOB.

# Stakes

- If the mission is failed the Aun's will gain awareness of espionage attempts making future retrievals more difficult with improved systems and possible a more aggressive approach to the civilians of Cornucopia.

# Reserves

- None at this time.
