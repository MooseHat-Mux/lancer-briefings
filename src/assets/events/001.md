The Black Tails succeed in infiltrating the Aunic skyhook subline vessel the Hammer of Woes. Upon the vessel the Black Tails encounter Aunic culture posing as traders who are then conscripted into the Crusade as ensigns. They detect their Lancer potential as well and requisition the construction of mechs. Shortly after the Hammer of Woes is attacked by rebels from Cornucopia who seek the same data caches as the Black Tails.
