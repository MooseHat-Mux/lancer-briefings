En-route to **Cornucopia** the newly formed lancer group the **Black Tails** convene on their mission of urgent genetic expansion. Guided by SSC C-Midnight Handler **Ke**, Group **Black Tails** were given loose guidelines until reaching the Boundary Garden where Omninet connection is limited. A clue to Ke's contact was given as an individual with blonde hair and ever changing eyes.

# Hammer of Woes // 9.26.5016u
The **Black Tails** succeed in infiltrating the Aunic skyhook subline vessel the **Hammer of Woes**. Upon the vessel the **Black Tails** encounter Aunic culture posing as traders. They submit to an Inquisition and search of their vessel at the hands of a manqueller titled First Order Potisto. Once finished they are sent to the Standard who then conscripts them into the Crusade as ensigns. They detect their Lancer potential as well and requisition the construction of mechs with plans to employ the talents of the **Black Tails** in a coming military action.
This however is postponed. The Hammer of Woes is attacked by rebels from Cornucopia who seek the same data caches as the Black Tails. Quickly deployed by the Auns the Black Tails use this oppertunity to acquire a group of subalterns and a latch drone and escape off the vessel before it's immenent destruction.
