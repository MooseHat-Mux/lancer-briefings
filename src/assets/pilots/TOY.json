My parents were staff on the ship, one an entertainer, the other a cook. I grew up working for the same cruise liner and eventually worked in the kitchen, but ended up dating the starship pilot. One time we had a group of Lancers vacationing on the cruise liner. I caught my pilot lover sleeping with one of the mech pilots. In foolhardy rage, I stole the mech suit and flew away. I scratched off all ID from the suit and crash landed on a remote base. I pretended to have total amnesia and learned the craft during my rehabilitation.</p><hr><p>Toy is probably more familiar with IPS-N than SSC life. At least until they took their semi yearly evaluation and the potential for a demolitions expert was revealed.
